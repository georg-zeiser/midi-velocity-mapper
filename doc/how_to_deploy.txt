instructions to deploy on a raspberry pi

make sure you have latest version of the project directory (git pull),
and all required tools (dotnet, nodejs/npm, angular) are installed and configured


1) fresh deployment:
    * webclient:
        * make sure your working directory is the root of the project
        * cd ./WebClient
        * npm install -f
        * npm run-script build

    * backend:
        * make sure your working directory is the root of the project
        * dotnet publish ./MidiVelocityMapper/MidiVelocityMapper.csproj -c Release -o ~/MidiVelocityMapper
        * sudo cp ./devops/midi_velocity_mapper.service /etc/systemd/system/midi_velocity_mapper.service
        * sudo systemctl enable midi_velocity_mapper.service
        * sudo systemctl start midi_velocity_mapper.service

2) update existing deployment:
    * webclient:
        * same as a fresh deployment

    * backend:
        * make sure your working directory is the root of the project
        * sudo systemctl stop midi_velocity_mapper.service
        * dotnet publish ./MidiVelocityMapper/MidiVelocityMapper.csproj -c Release -o ~/MidiVelocityMapper
        * sudo systemctl start midi_velocity_mapper.service
